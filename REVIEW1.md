# **Review - 1**: **Skill-based Career Recommendation System**

## **Abstract**

According to a recent study, most college
graduates find it challenging to choose their career
field. A lot of engineers are working to make IT the
dominant discipline. Therefore, they are doing
various online courses and aimlessly looking for
employment. Many students today are interested
in careers in the IT industry, but they are unsure of
which field is best for them. To avoid this situation
candidates, need a Job recommendation that
analyses the skills to recommend a suitable job for
the candidate. The solution is to design a system
that reads a resume and their skills.

## **Introduction**

A student may find it challenging to choose the correct job route because they are going
through a number of different stages at this time, including peer pressure and parental
pressure. Therefore, a model that directs the student based on his or her profile and skill ratings
can be designed to assist pupils in such situations. An algorithm can be used to pull special
characteristics from the profile and forecast both the best career option and the career options
one should avoid choosing. This will enable the learner to succeed in the area where he or she
is most talented.

This skill-based career recommendation system focuses on predicting the suitable jobs for the
candidates. It uses machine learning models to find similarities between jobs description and
resumes to predict accurately. This application can be used by any candidates who need or
who want to know about their suitable jobs and to improve themselves with both soft skills and
hard skills. It will be helpful to them by not wasting their time searching for jobs. They can also
grow their skills in their domain and grow faster in their domain.

## **Tools/Software Identified**

* **Anaconda** <br> Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

* **Spyder** <br>Spyder is an open-source cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in the Python language that integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython, as well as other open-source software.

* **Github Desktop** <br> GitHub, Inc is an Internet hosting service that provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.

* **Zotero** <br> Zotero is a free and open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials, such as PDF files. Features include web browser integration, online syncing, generation of in-text citations, footnotes, and bibliographies, an integrated PDF reader and note editor, as well as integration with the word processors Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer, and Google Docs. 

* **SQLite** <br> SQLite is a database engine written in the C programming language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library that software developers embed in their apps. As such, it belongs to the family of embedded databases.

* **Kaggle** <br> Kaggle is a data science community with tools and resources which include externally contributed machine learning
datasets of all kinds. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

* **Zettlr** <br> Zettlr is a markdown editor for writing articles, ebooks, and other types of content across platforms. It is
modelled after the personal knowledge management and note-taking Zettelkasten system. It supports
presentations (using the reveal.js framework), autocorrection, snippets, localization, math formulae, citations,
and custom templates.
