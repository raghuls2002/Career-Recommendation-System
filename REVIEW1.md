# **Review - 1** <br><br> **Skill-based Career Recommendation System**

## **Abstract**

According to a recent study, most college
graduates find it challenging to choose their career
field. A lot of engineers are working to make IT the
dominant discipline. Therefore, they are doing
various online courses and aimlessly looking for
employment. Many students today are interested
in careers in the IT industry, but they are unsure of
which field is best for them. To avoid this situation
candidates, need a Job recommendation that
analyses the skills to recommend a suitable job for
the candidate. The solution is to design a system
that reads a resume and their skills.

## **Introduction**

A student may find it challenging to choose the correct job route because they are going
through a number of different stages at this time, including peer pressure and parental
pressure. Therefore, a model that directs the student based on his or her profile and skill ratings
can be designed to assist pupils in such situations. An algorithm can be used to pull special
characteristics from the profile and forecast both the best career option and the career options
one should avoid choosing. This will enable the learner to succeed in the area where he or she
is most talented.

<br>

This skill-based career recommendation system focuses on predicting the suitable jobs for the
candidates. It uses machine learning models to find similarities between jobs description and
resumes to predict accurately. This application can be used by any candidates who need or
who want to know about their suitable jobs and to improve themselves with both soft skills and
hard skills. It will be helpful to them by not wasting their time searching for jobs. They can also
grow their skills in their domain and grow faster in their domain.
