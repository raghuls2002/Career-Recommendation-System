## Zotero

With the help of the free, open-source software Zotero, you can quickly gather, arrange, cite, and share sources. You can add source data to your library via a browser extension. 

### Adding Sources

There are many options available in Zotero for adding sources to your Library. The many methods for adding sources to your Zotero Library are described below: 

* **Browser Add-on (Connector)** <br>
  This will be the main method of adding sources from databases, the library catalogue, and free online resources.
  
* **Search Results List** <br> 
  When you wish to add numerous sources from a list of search results from a catalogue, database, or public web, use this option.
  
* **Google Schoolar** <br> 
  Normally, you should use the Browser Connector and navigate to the original source. That isn't always doable. Here is a different approach taken straight from the search results page.
  
* **PDF Files** <br>
  This is a quick and simple approach to add a source record to your Library if you have readable PDF files.
  
* **Manually Add a Source** <br>
  This will be the main method of adding sources from databases, the library catalogue, and free online resources.

## Github Desktop

Github is a platform for sharing files or source code with others. Version control is one of the main uses of GitHub. When more than one individual is engaged in a project, it is beneficial. Imagine that a group of software developers are working on a website and that they all need to update their codes at the same time. In this situation, Github aids in the development of a central repository where all code files can be uploaded, edited, and managed.

### Creating a repository

The project is kept in storage at a repository. It could be local, like a folder on your computer, or it might be an internet host like GitHub or another. Code files, text files, photos, or any other type of file can be stored in a repository. This GitHub repository acts as a remote repository. To create a Github repository, follow these steps: 

* Go to the link: https://github.com/ . Fill the sign up form and click on "Sign up for Github".
* Click on "Start a new project".
* Enter any repository name and click on "Create Repository". 
* Give a description to the repository (optional).

In contrast to a private repository, which allows users to control who can see its contents, the default GitHub repository is public, making its contents accessible to anybody.

### Creating Branches

Branches enable concurrent work on many versions of a repository. Imagine that we want to add a new feature—which is still in development—but we are unsure whether to update our primary project or not. Git branching comes to the rescue in this situation. Using branches, you can switch back and forth between a project's many stages and versions. To test the new feature in the aforementioned scenario, we can establish a new branch without affecting the main branch. When we are finished, we may combine the modifications from the new branch with those from the main branch. The master branch, which is present in your repository by default, is used as the main branch in this case.

### Performing Git Operations

#### Commit Command

We can save the changes to our file with the aid of this process. To remember the modifications we made to a file, we should always include a message when we commit it. Although this message is optional, it is always advised in order to distinguish between the many versions or changes you have made to our repository thus far. These commit messages keep track of the file's history of modifications, which helps other authors better understand the file. Let's make our first commitment now by taking the following actions:

* Click on “readme- changes” file which we have just created.
* Click on the “edit” or a pencil icon in the righmost corner of the file.
* Once you click on that, an editor will open where you can type in the changes or anything.
* Write a commit message which identifies your changes.
* Click commit changes in the end.

#### Pull Command

The most significant GitHub command is pull. It details the file's modifications and invites other contributors to view it and merge it into the master branch. Once the commit is done, anyone can pull the file and can start a discussion over it. Once its all done, you can merge the file. Pull command compares the changes which are done in the file and if there are any conflicts, you can manually resolve it. Now let us see different steps involved to pull request in GitHub.

* Click the ‘Pull requests’ 
* Click ‘New pull request’.
* Once you click on pull request, select the branch and click ‘readme- changes’ file to view changes between the two files present in our repository.
* Click "Create pull request".

#### Merge Command
