## Github Desktop

Github is a platform for sharing files or source code with others. Version control is one of the main uses of GitHub. When more than one individual is engaged in a project, it is beneficial. Imagine that a group of software developers are working on a website and that they all need to update their codes at the same time. In this situation, Github aids in the development of a central repository where all code files can be uploaded, edited, and managed.

### Creating a repository

The project is kept in storage at a repository. It could be local, like a folder on your computer, or it might be an internet host like GitHub or another. Code files, text files, photos, or any other type of file can be stored in a repository. This GitHub repository acts as a remote repository. To create a Github repository, follow these steps: 

* Go to the link: https://github.com/ . Fill the sign up form and click on "Sign up for Github".
* Click on "Start a new project".
* Enter any repository name and click on "Create Repository". 
* Give a description to the repository (optional).

In contrast to a private repository, which allows users to control who can see its contents, the default GitHub repository is public, making its contents accessible to anybody.

### Creating Branches and Performing Operations

Branches enable concurrent work on many versions of a repository. Imagine that we want to add a new feature—which is still in development—but we are unsure whether to update our primary project or not. Git branching comes to the rescue in this situation. Using branches, you can switch back and forth between a project's many stages and versions. To test the new feature in the aforementioned scenario, we can establish a new branch without affecting the main branch. When we are finished, we may combine the modifications from the new branch with those from the main branch. The master branch, which is present in your repository by default, is used as the main branch in this case.
