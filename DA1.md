## Github Desktop

Github is a platform for sharing files or source code with others. Version control is one of the main uses of GitHub. When more than one individual is engaged in a project, it is beneficial. Imagine that a group of software developers are working on a website and that they all need to update their codes at the same time. In this situation, Github aids in the development of a central repository where all code files can be uploaded, edited, and managed.

### Creating a repository

The project is kept in storage at a repository. It could be local, like a folder on your computer, or it might be an internet host like GitHub or another. Code files, text files, photos, or any other type of file can be stored in a repository. This GitHub repository acts as a remote repository. A Github repository can be created by following these steps: 

* Go to the link: https://github.com/ . Fill the sign up form and click on “Sign up for Github”.
* Click on "Start a new project".
* Enter any repository name and click on “Create Repository”. We can also give a description to our repository (optional).

The default a GitHub repository is public which means that anyone can view the contents of this repository whereas in a
private repository, we can choose who can view the content.
