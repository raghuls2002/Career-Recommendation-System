## Github Desktop

Github is a platform for sharing files or source code with others. Version control is one of the main uses of GitHub. When more than one individual is engaged in a project, it is beneficial. Imagine that a group of software developers are working on a website and that they all need to update their codes at the same time. In this situation, Github aids in the development of a central repository where all code files can be uploaded, edited, and managed.

### Creating a repository

The project is kept in storage at a repository. It could be local, like a folder on your computer, or it might be an internet host like GitHub or another. Code files, text files, photos, or any other type of file can be stored in a repository. This GitHub repository acts as a remote repository. To create a Github repository, follow these steps: 

* Go to the link: https://github.com/ . Fill the sign up form and click on "Sign up for Github".
* Click on "Start a new project".
* Enter any repository name and click on "Create Repository". 
* Give a description to the repository (optional).

In contrast to a private repository, which allows users to control who can see its contents, the default GitHub repository is public, making its contents accessible to anybody.

### Creating Branches and Performing Operations

Branches enable concurrent work on many versions of a repository. Imagine that we want to add a new feature—which is still in development—but we are unsure whether to update our primary project or not. Git branching comes to the rescue in this situation. Using branches, you can switch back and forth between a project's many stages and versions. To test the new feature in the aforementioned scenario, we can establish a new branch without affecting the main branch. When we are finished, we may combine the modifications from the new branch with those from the main branch. The master branch, which is present in your repository by default, is used as the main branch in this case.

### Commit Command

The most significant GitHub command is pull. It details the file's modifications and invites other contributors to view it and merge it into the master branch. Once the commit is done, anyone can pull the file and can start a discussion over it. Once its all done, you can merge the file. Pull command compares the changes which are done in the file and if there are any conflicts, you can manually resolve it. Now let us see different steps involved to pull request in GitHub.

* Click the ‘Pull requests’ 
* Click ‘New pull request’.
* Once you click on pull request, select the branch and click ‘readme- changes’ file to view changes between the two files present in our repository.
* Click "Create pull request".
